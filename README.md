# Hello, My name is Charles "Brad" Young
## About me
I did six years in the US Navy as a Network Technician for the Aegis Weapon System. I quickly realised my passion and love for computers and I knew I wanted to pursue a career in technology. 
I loved the idea about creating something for the world to see and quickly grew an interest in coding.
My other interest include online gaming, anime/manga, and spending time with my amazing wife.
## My road to becoming a Full-Stack Web Developer
1. Currently going through Codecademy Full-Stack course
